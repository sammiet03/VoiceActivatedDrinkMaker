# Voice Activated Drink Maker

### Overview 
- As a soon to be graduating Senior in Fall 2022, the school requires all Engineering majors to take a Senior Project class. The Senior Project class is separated into 2 semesters, Tech 190A and Tech 190B. In this year long class, you will be in a group made up of 4-6 other individuals that have different majors than your own. You are then expected to decide a project topic to work on for both of the semesters. The first semester Tech 190A consists of creating a prototype of your project topic. The second semester Tech 190B consists of presenting your final working version of your project topic and presenting it in a combined lecture of your own class and other sections of Tech 190B.

### Overview of First Semester Tech 190A 
- Deciding project topic 
- Creating Voice Activated Drink Maker Prototype 
- Materials used to create prototype: Arduino Uno, 12V Relay Module, 12V Power Supply, 12V Peristaltic Pump, Elechouse Voice Recognition Module, etc.
