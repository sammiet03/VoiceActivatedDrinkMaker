# Overview 
- For the first semester of my Senior Project class I was in charge of the coding and electrical components. In the semester I had a total of 13 weeks to: brainstorm project ideas, write a project proposal form, work on the project schedule, plan my process chart (how I was going to create the electronic prototype), order necessary materials, draw prototype designs on fritzing software, start the process of prototyping, troubleshoot issues with our prototype, and test the full circuit with code. 

### Prototype Idea 
- The project topic my group had decided on was creating a Voice Activated Drink Maker. This drink maker would respond to the users request for a drink and in return create the drink for the user. 
- Since this was the first semester of the class, we only had to have one property from our project to function 
- I had decided that it would be a voice activated circuit to pour water when the user prompted the machine for it.
